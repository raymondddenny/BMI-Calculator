# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## My Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to look at how we can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve our own beautiful user interface designs. If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, we can create them using Flutter. 


## What did i create

Weâ€™re going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Kevin Al-Rizal ](https://dribbble.com/shots/11368106-BMI-Calculator-App-Neumorphism). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
